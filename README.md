# Favorite Holiday 

### Create a webpage that describes your favorite holiday destination. The webpage should include the following elements:

- A heading (h1) with the name of the holiday destination
- A paragraph that provides a brief overview of the destination
- A line break between the heading and the paragraph
- An ordered list that lists the top 5 attractions in the destination
- An unordered list that lists the must-try foods in the destination
- Text within the ordered and unordered lists should be bold (strong or b) and/or italicized (em or i) to emphasize important information.
